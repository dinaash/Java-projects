# Java projects

Using Java, I have conducted a quantitative study on two database systems, MongoDB and a relational database MySQL.

I wrote a multi-threaded client program that sends and receives concurrently different types of complex data queries involving aggregate and average calculations that span tables or collections of records. My program measured and recorded the database performance in terms of average latency and operations per second at various levels of distribution of database servers.
