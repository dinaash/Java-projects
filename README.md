# Java projects

Using Java, I have conducted a quantitative study on two database systems, MongoDB and a relational database MySQL.

I wrote multi-threaded client programs that send and receive concurrently different types of complex data queries involving aggregate and average calculations that span tables or collections of records. My programs measure and record the database performance in terms of average latency at various levels of distribution of database servers.
